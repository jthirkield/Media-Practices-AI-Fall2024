    "Welcome to Python! Python is a programming language that is particularly powerful at dealing with multiple text documents, running statistics, and running machine learning algorithms (and much much more!). There are many libraries and extensions of Python that make it a very effective and useful language.\n",

    "\n",
    "(Note: In Python arrays are called \"lists\", and objects are called \"dictionaries\".)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment I will ask you to pick five relatively short texts (poems, paragraphs, short essays, song lyrics, whatever interests you). The main thing is to make sure that each text is around 10 - 20 lines or sentences long. Below, I have selected five poems by Wallace Stevens. In each cell I have made a variable that contains each poem, and then I pass that poem through a function called `text_to_dict` that makes a dictionary for each poem. The dictionary contains the title of the poem, the full text as one string, and a list that contains each line of the poem. The function will also make lists of sentences instead of lines if you want to investigate a prose text (sentence by sentence) instead of a poem (line by line).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts of this assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1**, which should be easy, is to replace the poems with texts of your own choice--and choose to split them by lines or sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2** is to write functions that and investigate your texts. If you want to focus on the functions first, you can go straight to Part 2 and use the pomes I have chosen. You can then go back and enter your own texts--your functions should work no matter what text you've chosen.\n"
